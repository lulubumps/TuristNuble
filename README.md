# Description
About I found our thesis project, but I didn't find the life project with her :c

# Features
And the day came to add a README.md to this project. "Turist Ã‘uble" was a project created by students of the Technological University of Chile INACAP ChillÃ¡n, as their thesis. The final objective was to promote tourism in the new Region of Ã‘uble and promote the use of technology. The application is based on the purpose of integrating Augmented Reality, identifying the main locations of the city of ChillÃ¡n (in its first stage) and providing the user with cultural and historical information of the city. On the other hand, the application had a web version developed in Laravel with Laravel Voyager, which collected the user's information to analyze the points scanned with the app and thus be able to deliver information on the busiest times and places in the city.
